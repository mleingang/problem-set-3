<h2>Positions</h2>
  <h3>Offense</h3>
    <p>In most situations, offensive players are the ones who score the
      goals for their team. As exciting, and perhaps even simple, as this
      may sound, there are actually many skills required to be a successful
      attacker.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Advanced levels of ball control</li>
      <li>Good understanding of proper positioning</li>
      <li>Powerful shot</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Advanced levels of ball control are what really set good offensive
      players from great ones. Great offensive players are able to make the
      ball do their bidding, giving them an advantage against opposing
      defenders. In addition, ball control helps the offensive player keep
      the ball in his or her team's possesion.</p>
    <p>It is important for all players to understand proper positioning, but
      positioning is especially useful to offenive players. When attempting
      to score a goal, fowards need to work together to get around the
      defense and goalkeeper. Positioning allows them to know where on the
      field they will be most useful to the other fowards in their attempt
      to score a goal.</p>
    <p>The most obvious, and arguably most imprtant skill that a foward must
      have is a powerful shot. Since these players are usually the ones
      scoring the goals for the team, they must have the ability to do so.
      The stronger a player's shot, the more difficult it is for the
      goalkeeper to make a save, making them more likely to score.</p>
  <h3>Midfielder</h3>
    <p>Midfield is another one of the standard positions in soccer. A
      midfielder's job is to bridge the gap between the offense and defense.
      This means that players in this position must pull a lot of weight
      in order for their team to be successful. Some of the most important
      characteristics of a good midfielder are as follows.
    <ul>
      <li>Ball control</li>
      <li>Passing abilities</li>
      <li>Stamina</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Defense</h3>
  <h3>Goalkeeper</h3>
    <p>There is one exception to the no-hands rule. Goalkeepers
    are the teams' last defense when it comes to protecting the goal from an
    attacker's attempt to score a goal, therefore gaining a point for their
    team.</p>
