    <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>Soccer is one of the many sports played by people worldwide. Millions
         of people play, and players' levels range from recreational play to
         professional play. See your local soccer club for information on how to
         join a team in your area!</p>
    <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>To play soccer, you'll first need a team. Specific regulations, such as
         how many players are on the field at once, vary from age level to age
         level. See the chart below to find out which rules differ, and which ones
         your team should follow.</p>
      <p>The basic rules of the game are as follows. The most important thing to
        know about soccer is that players are not allowed to use their hands to
        control the ball. The aim of the game is to score a point by getting
        the soccer ball in the opposing team's goal. To do this, players can use
        any body part (except for hands).
      <h3>Positions</h3>
        <h4>Offense</h4>
          <p>In most situations, offensive players are the ones who score the
            goals for their team. As exciting, and perhaps even simple, as this
            may sound, there are actually many skills required to be a successful
            attacker.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advanced levels of ball control</li>
            <li>Good understanding of proper positioning</li>
            <li>Powerful shot</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Advanced levels of ball control are what really set good offensive
            players from great ones. Great offensive players are able to make the
            ball do their bidding, giving them an advantage against opposing
            defenders. In addition, ball control helps the offensive player keep
            the ball in his or her team's possesion.</p>
          <p>It is important for all players to understand proper positioning, but
            positioning is especially useful to offenive players. When attempting
            to score a goal, fowards need to work together to get around the
            defense and goalkeeper. Positioning allows them to know where on the
            field they will be most useful to the other fowards in their attempt
            to score a goal.</p>
          <p>The most obvious, and arguably most imprtant skill that a foward must
            have is a powerful shot. Since these players are usually the ones
            scoring the goals for the team, they must have the ability to do so.
            The stronger a player's shot, the more difficult it is for the
            goalkeeper to make a save, making them more likely to score.</p>
        <h4>Midfielder</h4>
          <p>Midfield is another one of the standard positions in soccer. A
            midfielder's job is to bridge the gap between the offense and defense.
            This means that players in this position must pull a lot of weight
            in order for their team to be successful. Some of the most important
            characteristics of a good midfielder are as follows.
          <ul>
            <li>Ball control</li>
            <li>Passing abilities</li>
            <li>Stamina</li>
          </ul>
        <h4>Defense</h4>
        <h4>Goalkeeper</h4>
          <p>There is one exception to the no-hands rule. Goalkeepers
          are the teams' last defense when it comes to protecting the goal from an
          attacker's attempt to score a goal, therefore gaining a point for their
          team.
