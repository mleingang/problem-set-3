         of people play, and players' levels range from recreational to
         professional. See your local soccer club for information on how to

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
      <p>To play soccer, you'll first need a team. Specific regulations, such as
         how many players are on the field at once, vary from age level to age
         level. See the chart below to find out which rules differ, and which ones
         your team should follow.</p>
      <p>The most important thing to know about soccer is that players are not
        allowed to use their hands to control the ball. The aim of the game is
        to score a point by getting the soccer ball in the opposing team's goal.
        To do this, players can use any body part (except for hands).
