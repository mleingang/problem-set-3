    <h1>Get Involved</h1>
      <p>Do you love soccer and want to know how you can get involved with the sport?
        There are a few easy ways to make an impact <em>and</em> have fun! Here you'll
        discover how you can potentially make soccer into a part-time job.</p>
    <h2>Coaching</h2>
      <p>The easiest way to get involved with soccer in your community is to coach a team.
      While coaching is a tough and time-consuming task, it can also be a fun experience.
      Coaches are essential to the success of a team, and if you want to help younger
      players shine, then becomming one might just be the perfect option for you!</p>
    <h3>Becomming a Coach</h3>
      <p>If you want to coach a team, you must first contact your local soccer club
       to find out if there are any open positions. If the club has a team without
       a coach, you may be asked to fill in this opening. But, if you know a group of
       potential players, you may also request to be their coach.</p>
    <h3>Improving your Coaching</h3>
        <p>Much like being a player, coaching requires a specific set of skills too.
          Coaches need to be patient with their players, as they are the ones teaching
          them how to play and how to improve their skils. </p>
